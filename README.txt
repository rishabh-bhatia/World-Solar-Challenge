This is the master git repository for the World Solar Car Challenge Tribe.

Although this is still a bit experimental, this repository should only be
forked by project squads (it should not be cloned or otherwise!) and pull
request created for agreed deliverables.

If you have any questions about the usage of this repository, please contact
the Tribe leader Prof. Jean-Guy Schneider <jeanguy.schneider@deakin.edu.au>
