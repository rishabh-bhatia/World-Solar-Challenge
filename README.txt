This is the git repository for the World Solar Car Challenge Squad 1 for
Trimester 1, 2019. It is a fork of the WSC's Master repository that has
been created fot this squad.

Although this is still a bit experimental, this repository should be used
by this squad. For agreed deliverables, pull requests should be created on
the Master repository - they will then be approved or rejected.

If you have any questions about the usage of this repository, please contact
the Tribe leader Prof. Jean-Guy Schneider <jeanguy.schneider@deakin.edu.au>
